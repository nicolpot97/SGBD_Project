JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
See http://www.JSON.org/

JSON_checker is a Pushdown Automaton that very quickly determines if a JSON
text is syntactically correct. It could be used to filter inputs to a system,
or to verify that the outputs of a system are syntactically correct. It could
be adapted to produce a very fast JSON parser.

JSON_checker is made up of these files:

    JSON_checker.c      The JSON_checker.
    JSON_checker.h      The JSON_checker header file.

    main.c              A sample application.

Accessories:

    utf8_to_utf16.c     A UTF-8 to UTF-16 converter.
    utf8_to_utf16.h     The UTF-8 to UTF-16 converter header file.
    utf8_decode.c       A UTF-8 decoder.
    utf8_decode.h       The UTF-8 decoder header file.
